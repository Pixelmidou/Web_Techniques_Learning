Important Notes about the "Fetch API":

* The Fetch API can be implemented using two syntaxes (all of which are async) :

** "Promise-Chain" / "Promise-Based" syntax :
- Example : 
	fetch("sample.txt") 
	.then(x => x.text())
	.then(y => myDisplay(y));
- This syntax is used mostly for parallel executions

** "Async/Await" Syntax : 
- Example :
	async function getText(file) {
	  let x = await fetch(file);
	  let y = await x.text();
	  myDisplay(y);
	}
- This syntax is used for sequential executions : 
  the "await" keywords waits for the previous operation to complete before executing the current one	
	+ Elaborating : x.text() won't get executed till the fetch(file) is completed
